Task 1: Maximum Count
</h2>

You are given an array of integers.

Write a script to return the maximum between the number of positive and negative integers. Zero is neither positive nor negative.
### Example 1
```
Input: @ints = (-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3)
Output: 3

There are 3 positive integers.
There are 3 negative integers.
The maximum between 3 and 3 is 3.
```
### Example 2
```
Input: @ints = (-2, -1, 0, 0, 1)
Output: 2

There are 1 positive integers.
There are 2 negative integers.
The maximum between 2 and 1 is 2.
```
### Example 3
```
Input: @ints = (1, 2, 3, 4)
Output: 4

There are 4 positive integers.
There are 0 negative integers.
The maximum between 4 and 0 is 4.
```

### Solution
This task invites to some math fun.

It can easily be seen that for any two (real) numbers $$a, b$$ the following equation holds:

$$
\max(a, b) = \frac{a + b + |a - b|}{2}
$$

With

$$
\operatorname{sign}(x) =
\begin{cases}
1& \text{if } x > 0,\\
0& \text{if } x = 0,\\
-1& \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}
$$

let $$s_k = \operatorname{sign}(i_k)$$ be the signs of the given integers $$i_k$$ and $$n$$ and $$p$$ the number of negative resp. positive integers from $$i_k$$.

Then we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
p + n &= \sum |s_k| \\
p - n &= \sum s_k
\end{aligned}
$$

resulting in the nice formula

$$
\max(p,n) = \frac{\sum |s_k| + |\sum s_k|}{2}
$$


The translation into [`PDL`](https://metacpan.org/pod/PDL) is straightforward:
```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use PDL;

sub max_count {
    my $s = long(@_)->clip(-1, 1);
    (sum(abs $s) + abs(sum $s)) / 2;
}
```

Task 2: Sum Difference
</h2>
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

---
You are given an array of positive integers.

Write a script to return the absolute difference between digit sum and element sum of the given array.
### Example 1
```
Input: @ints = (1, 23, 4, 5)
Output: 18

Element sum: 1 + 23 + 4 + 5 => 33
Digit sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 => 15
Absolute difference: | 33 - 15 | => 18
```
### Example 2
```
Input: @ints = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Output: 0

Element sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 => 15
Digit sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 => 15
Absolute difference: | 15 - 15 | => 0
```
### Example 3
```
Input: @ints = (1, 2, 34)
Output: 27

Element sum: 1 + 2 + 34 => 37
Digit sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 => 10
Absolute difference: | 37 - 10 | => 27
```
---
### Solution
A number is never smaller than its digit sum in any base and therefore we do not need to apply the "absolute difference".

```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use Math::Prime::Util qw(vecsum todigits);

use constant BASE => 10;

sub sum_diff {
    vecsum(@_) - vecsum map todigits($_, BASE), @_;
}
```
