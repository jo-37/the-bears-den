Task 1: Maximal Square
</h2>
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

---
You are given an `m x n` binary matrix with `0` and `1` only.

Write a script to find the largest square containing only `1`'s and return itâ€™s area.

### Example 1
```
Input: @matrix = ([1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
                  [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
                  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
                  [1, 0, 0, 1, 0])
Output: 4

Two maximal square found with same size marked as 'x':

[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
[1, 0, x, x, 1]
[1, 1, x, x, 1]
[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]

[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
[1, 0, 1, x, x]
[1, 1, 1, x, x]
[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
```
### Example 2
```
Input: @matrix = ([0, 1],
                  [1, 0])
Output: 1

Two maximal square found with same size marked as 'x':

[0, x]
[1, 0]


[0, 1]
[x, 0]
```
### Example 3
```
Input: @matrix = ([0])
Output: 0
```
---
### Solution
From [example 3](#example-3) it follows that one-dimensional input is allowed.
While tolerating this, we'll always operate on a two-dimensional binary $$m \times n$$ matrix $$B = (b_{i,k})$$ where any of $$m$$ or $$n$$ may be one.

For $$ l \le \min(m, n)$$ we may define a binary $$(m - l + 1 ) \times (n - l + 1)$$ matrix $$B^l = (b_{i,k}^l)$$, where $$b_{i,k}^l = 1$$ if and only if the square submatrix of $$B$$ with length $$l$$ having the upper left corner $$b_{i,k}$$ consists of `1`s only.

Obviously we have $$B^1 = B$$.

Analyzing $$B^l$$:
- If $$B^l$$ is a zero matrix, then $$B$$ doesn't contain a square of length $$l$$ consisting of `1`s only.
- If $$B^l$$ is not zero, but has only one row or column, then $$B$$'s maximum square length is $$l$$.
- Otherwise we have $$l < \min(m, n)$$, i.e. $$B^l$$ has at least two rows and columns.

Then we find $$B^{l+1}$$ as:

$$
b^{l+1}_{i,k} = b^l_{i,k} \wedge b^l_{i+1,k} \wedge b^l_{i,k+1} \wedge b^l_{i+1,k+1}
$$

We may iterate over $$B^l$$ starting from $$B^1 = B$$ until either $$B^l$$ is a zero matrix or has only one row or column.
According to the above rules, we find the maximum square length of $$B$$ then.

For the requested size as result we need to square the final length.

Extracting rectangular subarrays from an ndarray is what [`PDL`](https://metacpan.org/pod/PDL)'s [`range`](https://metacpan.org/pod/PDL::Slices#range) method is made for.
Here is a demonstration of extracting $$2 \times 2$$ submatrices in the [PDL shell](https://metacpan.org/dist/PDL/view/Basic/Core/perldl):
```
pdl> do_print 1
1
pdl> $m = sequence 3, 3

[
 [0 1 2]
 [3 4 5]
 [6 7 8]
]

pdl> $m->range(ndcoords($m(0:-2,0:-2)), 2)->reorder(2, 3, 0, 1)

[
 [
  [
   [0 1]
   [3 4]
  ]
  [
   [1 2]
   [4 5]
  ]
 ]
 [
  [
   [3 4]
   [6 7]
  ]
  [
   [4 5]
   [7 8]
  ]
 ]
]

```
This leads to the following implementation:
```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use PDL;
use PDL::NiceSlice;

sub max_square {
    my $m = long @_;
    $m = $m->dummy(1) if $m->ndims < 2;
    for (my $len = 1;; $len++) {
        return ($len - 1)**2 if !any($m);
        return $len**2 if min($m->shape) < 2;
        $m = $m->range(ndcoords($m(0:-2,0:-2)), 2)
            ->reorder(2, 3, 0, 1)->andover->andover;
    }
}
```
Here are the matrices $$B^l$$ for [example 1](#example-1) leading to $$l_{\max} = 2$$:
```
pdl> $m = long [1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]

[
 [1 0 1 0 0]
 [1 0 1 1 1]
 [1 1 1 1 1]
 [1 0 0 1 0]
]

pdl> $m = $m->range(ndcoords($m(0:-2,0:-2)),2)->reorder(2, 3, 0, 1)->andover->andover

[
 [0 0 0 0]
 [0 0 1 1]
 [0 0 0 0]
]

pdl> $m = $m->range(ndcoords($m(0:-2,0:-2)),2)->reorder(2, 3, 0, 1)->andover->andover

[
 [0 0 0]
 [0 0 0]
]
```
#### Other examples
The radius $$r$$ of the circumcircle of a square with an edge length $$a$$ is $$r = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}$$.
Approximating a circle with $$r = 7$$ in a binary $$31 \times 31$$ matrix.
The largest square therein should have an edge length of $$\lfloor 7 \sqrt{2} \rfloor = 9$$, leading to an area $$A = 81$$.
Let's try it:

```
pdl> do_print 1
1
pdl> floor 7 * 2**.5
9
pdl> $b = rvals(31, 31, {centre => [15, 15]}) <= 7

Task 2: Right Interval
</h2>
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

---
You are given an array of `@intervals`, where `$intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` and each `starti` is unique.

The right interval for an interval `i` is an interval `j` such that `startj >= endi` and `startj` is minimized. Please note that `i` may equal `j`.

Write a script to return an array of right interval indices for each interval `i`. If no right interval exists for interval `i`, then put `-1` at index `i`.

### Example 1
```
Input: @intervals = ([3,4], [2,3], [1,2])
Output: (-1, 0, 1)

There is no right interval for [3,4].
The right interval for [2,3] is [3,4] since start0 = 3 is the smallest start that is >= end1 = 3.
The right interval for [1,2] is [2,3] since start1 = 2 is the smallest start that is >= end2 = 2.
```
### Example 2
```
Input: @intervals = ([1,4], [2,3], [3,4])
Output: (-1, 2, -1)

There is no right interval for [1,4] and [3,4].
The right interval for [2,3] is [3,4] since start2 = 3 is the smallest start that is >= end1 = 3.
```
### Example 3
```
Input: @intervals = ([1,2])
Output: (-1)

There is only one interval in the collection, so it outputs -1.
```
### Example 4
```
Input: @intervals = ([1,4], [2, 2], [3, 4])
Output: (-1, 1, -1)
```
---
### Solution
First we sort the intervals by their `start` and their `end` values resulting in a _right_ and a _left_ list.
Then we pick the first interval from the _right_ list and loop over the _left_ list.

If the _right_ interval is not valid for the _left_ interval, i.e. the _right_ `start` is less than the _left_ `end`, we proceed in the _right_ list until we find a valid interval and we assign the _right_ intervals's index to the result at the _left_ intervals index position.

The crucial point is to keep the _right_ interval when proceeding to the next _left_ interval as all the `start` values in the intervals preceding the _right_ interval are too small for the `end` values of all following _left_ intervals and therefore only a single pass over the _right_ list is required.

With a little trick we may handle the case of "no right interval" easily: We append an "match all" interval with an infinite `start` to the list of _right_ intervals that is accessible with the index `-1`.

The total time complexity of this procedure is dominated by the sorting, which is $$\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$$.

```perl
use v5.20;
use warnings;
use List::MoreUtils 'nsort_by';
use POSIX 'Inf';
use experimental 'signatures';

sub right_interval (@ints) {
    my @left  = nsort_by {$ints[$_][1]} 0 .. $#ints;
    push @ints, [Inf];
    my @right = nsort_by {$ints[$_][0]} -1 .. $#ints - 1;

    my @result;
    my $r = shift @right;
    for my $l (@left) {
        $r = shift @right while $ints[$r][0] < $ints[$l][1];
        $result[$l] = $r;
    }

    \@result;
}
```
