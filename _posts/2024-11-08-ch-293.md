Task 1: Similar Dominos
</h2>
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

---
You are given a list of dominos, `@dominos`.

Write a script to return the number of dominoes that are similar to any other domino.

> $dominos[i] = [a, b] and $dominos[j] = [c, d] are same if either (a = c and b = d) or (a = d and b = c).

### Example 1
```
Input: @dominos = ([1, 3], [3, 1], [2, 4], [6, 8])
Output: 2

Similar Dominos: $dominos[0], $dominos[1]
```
### Example 2
```
Input: @dominos = ([1, 2], [2, 1], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2])
Output: 3

Similar Dominos: $dominos[0], $dominos[1], $dominos[3]
```
---
### Solution
A few steps to solve this task:
- turn all dominoes such that the smaller value comes first
- sort the dominoes
- count the number of repetitions of the same domino in the sorted list
- sum over all counts that are larger than one.

```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use PDL;

sub count_similar {
    my ($c) = long(@_)->qsort->qsortvec->rlevec;

    $c->where($c > 1)->sum;
}
```

Task 2: Boomerang
</h2>
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

---
You are given an array of points, `(x, y)`.

Write a script to find out if the given points are a boomerang.

> A boomerang is a set of three points that are all distinct and not in a straight line.

### Example 1
```
Input: @points = ( [1, 1], [2, 3], [3,2] )
Output: true
```
### Example 2
```
Input: @points = ( [1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 3] )
Output: false
```
### Example 3
```
Input: @points = ( [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3] )
Output: true
```
### Example 4
```
Input: @points = ( [1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3] )
Output: false
```
### Example 5
```
Input: @points = ( [1, 1], [2, 1], [3, 1] )
Output: false
```
### Example 6
```
Input: @points = ( [0, 0], [2, 3], [4, 5] )
Output: true
```
---
### Solution
From the given three points we get two vectors by taking the difference between two pairs of points.
The resulting vectors must not be collinear, i.e. the determinant of the matrix formed by the two vectors must not be zero.
```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use PDL;
use PDL::NiceSlice;

sub is_boomerang {
    my $p = long @_;

    !!($p(,1:-1) - $p(,0:-2))->determinant
}
```
