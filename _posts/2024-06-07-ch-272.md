<h2 id="task-1">
Task 1: Defang IP Address
</h2>
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

---
You are given a valid IPv4 address.

Write a script to return the defanged version of the given IP address.

> A defanged IP address replaces every period “.” with “[.]".

### Example 1
```
Input: $ip = "1.1.1.1"
Output: "1[.]1[.]1[.]1"
```
### Example 2
```
Input: $ip = "255.101.1.0"
Output: "255[.]101[.]1[.]0"
```

### Solution
Just putting square brackets around dots seems to be too easy for a task.
So at least let us verify the input string as a valid IPv4 address.

But there is another interesting aspect: We may substitute the *regular expression* `[.]` with the *string* `[.]`.
Utilizing proper delimiters and a little fantasy, we arrive at an expression with a pair of snake eyes fixated on us.
Shouldn't we better defang that snake?
```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use Regexp::Common 'net';

sub defang {
    return /^$RE{net}{IPv4}$/ &&

    s([.])([.])gr

    for shift;
}
```

Task 2: String Score
</h2>
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

---

Write a script to return the score of the given string.

> The score of a string is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters.

### Example 1
```
Input: $str = "hello"
Output: 13

ASCII values of characters:
h = 104
e = 101
l = 108
l = 108
o = 111

Score => |104 - 101| + |101 - 108| + |108 - 108| + |108 - 111|
      => 3 + 7 + 0 + 3
      => 13
```
### Example 2
```
Input: "perl"
Output: 30

ASCII values of characters:
p = 112
e = 101
r = 114
l = 108

Score => |112 - 101| + |101 - 114| + |114 - 108|
      => 11 + 13 + 6
      => 30
```
### Example 3
```
Input: "raku"
Output: 37

ASCII values of characters:
r = 114
a = 97
k = 107
u = 117

Score => |114 - 97| + |97 - 107| + |107 - 117|
      => 17 + 10 + 10
      => 37
```

### Solution
The subclass [`PDL::Char`](https://metacpan.org/pod/PDL::Char) of `PDL` comes handy, when dealing with fixed sized arrays of ASCII characters.
By converting them back to a true numeric type, computations on the strings may be performed easily.
```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use PDL;
use PDL::NiceSlice;
use PDL::Char;

sub score {
    my $s = PDL::Char->new(shift);
    sum abs long($s(0:-2)) - long($s(1:-1));
}
```
