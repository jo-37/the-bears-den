# Sum Even Bits

## Task 1: Count Even Digits Number
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

---
You are given a array of positive integers, `@ints`.

Write a script to find out how many integers have even number of digits.

### Example 1
```
Input: @ints = (10, 1, 111, 24, 1000)
Output: 3

There are 3 integers having even digits i.e. 10, 24 and 1000.
```
### Example 2
```
Input: @ints = (111, 1, 11111)
Output: 0
```
### Example 3
```
Input: @ints = (2, 8, 1024, 256)
Output: 1
```
---
### Solution
Convert the number into base B representation and `grep` for those having an even number of digits.
```perl
use Math::Prime::Util 'todigits';

sub cedn {
    my $base = shift;
    scalar grep !(scalar(todigits($_, $base)) % 2), @_
}
```

## Task 2: Sum of Values
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

---
You are given an array of integers, `@int` and an integer `$k`.

Write a script to find the sum of values whose index binary representation has exactly `$k` number of 1-bit set.

### Example 1
```
Input: @ints = (2, 5, 9, 11, 3), $k = 1
Output: 17

Binary representation of index 0 = 0
Binary representation of index 1 = 1
Binary representation of index 2 = 10
Binary representation of index 3 = 11
Binary representation of index 4 = 100

So the indices 1, 2 and 4 have total one 1-bit sets.
Therefore the sum, $ints[1] + $ints[2] + $ints[4] = 17
```
### Example 2
```
Input: @ints = (2, 5, 9, 11, 3), $k = 2
Output: 11
```
### Example 3
```
Input: @ints = (2, 5, 9, 11, 3), $k = 0
Output: 2
```

### Solution
`unpack`'s format `'%32b*'` provides a simple way to count the bits in a bit vector.
Packing each of the numbers indices, counting its bits, `grep`ing for exactly `$k` bits, take the result as an array slice and sum over its elements.
```perl
use List::Util 'sum0';

sub k_bit_sum {
    my $k = shift;

    sum0 @_[grep unpack('%32b*', pack('l', $_)) == $k, 0 .. $#_];
}
```
