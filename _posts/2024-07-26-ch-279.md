Task 1: Sort Letters
</h2>
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

---
You are given two arrays, `@letters` and `@weights`.

Write a script to sort the given array `@letters` based on the `@weights`.

### Example 1
```
Input: @letters = ('R', 'E', 'P', 'L')
       @weights = (3, 2, 1, 4)
Output: PERL
```
### Example 2
```
Input: @letters = ('A', 'U', 'R', 'K')
       @weights = (2, 4, 1, 3)
Output: RAKU
```
### Example 3
```
Input: @letters = ('O', 'H', 'Y', 'N', 'P', 'T')
       @weights = (5, 4, 2, 6, 1, 3)
Output: PYTHON
```

### Solution
This task is very similar to [task #1 from challenge 278](/the-bears-den/2024/07/19/ch-278.html#task-1) with one significant difference:
Now I've seen solutions to last week's challenge that are much better than mine.

I'll assume the weights to be in the range $$1 \ldots n$$ without gaps or repetitions.
Then the weights can be used as (one-based) indices in a target array where the source characters are to be placed.

```perl
use v5.24;
use warnings;
use experimental 'signatures';

sub sort_letters ($letters, $weights) {
    (\my @word)->@[map $_ - 1, @$weights] = @$letters;
    join '', @word;
}
```

Task 2: Split String
</h2>
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

---
You are given a string, `$str`.

Write a script to split the given string into two containing exactly same number of vowels and return true if you can otherwise false.

### Example 1
```
Input: $str = "perl"
Ouput: false
```
### Example 2
```
Input: $str = "book"
Ouput: true

Two possible strings "bo" and "ok" containing exactly one vowel each.
```
### Example 3
```
Input: $str = "good morning"
Ouput: true

Two possible strings "good " and "morning" containing two vowels each or "good m" and "orning" containing two vowels each.
```
---
### Solution
Here we need to check if the given string contains an even number of vowels.
Using the `tr///` operator to count them.

```perl
use strict;
use warnings;

sub split_string {
    local $_ = shift;

    !(tr/aeiouAEIOU// % 2);
}
```
