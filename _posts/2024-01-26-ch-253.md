# Weakest Strings

## Task 1: Split Strings
**Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar**

---
You are given an array of strings and a character separator.

Write a script to return all words separated by the given character excluding empty string.

### Example 1
```
Input: @words = ("one.two.three","four.five","six")
       $separator = "."
Output: "one","two","three","four","five","six"
Example 2
Input: @words = ("$perl$$", "$$raku$")
       $separator = "$"
Output: "perl","raku"
```
---
### Solution
There are two particularities one must be aware of:

  *  the `split` function may produce empty fields
  *  the separator might contain regex meta characters

The former will be addressed by the usage of `grep` to filter out empty fields and the latter by using `quotemeta` on the separator.
```
sub split_strings {
    my $sep = shift;
    grep length, map +(split /\Q$sep/), @_;
}
```

## Task 2: Weakest Row
**Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar**

---
You are given an `m x n` binary matrix i.e. only 0 and 1 where 1 always appear before 0.

A row `i` is weaker than a row `j` if one of the following is true:
```
a) The number of 1s in row i is less than the number of 1s in row j.
b) Both rows have the same number of 1 and i < j.
```
Write a script to return the order of rows from weakest to strongest.

### Example 1
```
Input: $matrix = [
                   [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                   [1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
                   [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                   [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                   [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
                 ]
Output: (2, 0, 3, 1, 4)

The number of 1s in each row is:
- Row 0: 2
- Row 1: 4
- Row 2: 1
- Row 3: 2
- Row 4: 5
```
### Example 2
```
Input: $matrix = [
                   [1, 0, 0, 0],
                   [1, 1, 1, 1],
                   [1, 0, 0, 0],
                   [1, 0, 0, 0]
                 ]
Output: (0, 2, 3, 1)

The number of 1s in each row is:
- Row 0: 1
- Row 1: 4
- Row 2: 1
- Row 3: 1
```

### Solution
We *might* take the matrix' rows as binary representation of some integers.
Under the preconditions of this task, two rows with the same number of ones represent the same number and a row with less ones than another represents a smaller number.

One approach thus would be to convert the rows to integers and perform a stable index sort on them.

On the other hand, the preconditions seem a bit artificial.
The above approach is naturally applicable to arbitrary binary matrices.

Going one step further: We may look at a matrix having integer elements without further restriction and compare rows lexicographically.
Then this task turns out to be a very special case of a stable lexicographical index sort on the matrix' rows.

Using `PDL` again for its easy matrix handling.
However, `PDL`'s sort implementation is not stable, thus we have to take masures to keep the order of equal rows.
Therefore we append an extra column holding the row indices.
```
use PDL;
use PDL::NiceSlice;

sub weakest {
    my $m = pdl @_;
    $m->append($m((0))->ndcoords)->qsortveci;
}
```
