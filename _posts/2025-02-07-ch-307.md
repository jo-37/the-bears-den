Task 1: Check Order
</h2>
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

---
You are given an array of integers, `@ints`.

Write a script to re-arrange the given array in an increasing order and return the indices where it differs from the original array.

### Example 1
```
Input: @ints = (5, 2, 4, 3, 1)
Output: (0, 2, 3, 4)

Before: (5, 2, 4, 3, 1)
After : (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

Difference at indices: (0, 2, 3, 4)
```
### Example 2
```
Input: @ints = (1, 2, 1, 1, 3)
Output: (1, 3)

Before: (1, 2, 1, 1, 3)
After : (1, 1, 1, 2, 3)

Difference at indices: (1, 3)
```
### Example 3
```
Input: @ints = (3, 1, 3, 2, 3)
Output: (0, 1, 3)

Before: (3, 1, 3, 2, 3)
After : (1, 2, 3, 3, 3)

Difference at indices: (0, 1, 3)
```

### Solution
Translated to `PDL`, the task reads
> In which indices disagree the integers and the sorted integers?

And so it goes:
```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use PDL;

sub check_order {
    my $ints = long \@_;
    which $ints != $ints->qsort;
}
```

<h2 id="task-2">
Task 2: Find Anagrams
</h2>
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

---
You are given a list of words, `@words`.

Write a script to find any two consecutive words and if they are anagrams, drop the first word and keep the second. You continue this until there is no more anagrams in the given list and return the count of final list.

### Example 1
```
Input: @words = ("acca", "dog", "god", "perl", "repl")
Output: 3

Step 1: "dog" and "god" are anagrams, so dropping "dog"
        and keeping "god" => ("acca", "god", "perl", "repl")
Step 2: "perl" and "repl" are anagrams, so dropping "perl"
        and keeping "repl" => ("acca", "god", "repl")
```
### Example 2
```
Input: @words = ("abba", "baba", "aabb", "ab", "ab")
Output: 2

Step 1: "abba" and "baba" are anagrams, so dropping "abba"
        and keeping "baba" => ("baba", "aabb", "ab", "ab")
Step 2: "baba" and "aabb" are anagrams, so dropping "baba"
        and keeping "aabb" => ("aabb", "ab", "ab")
Step 3: "ab" and "ab" are anagrams, so dropping "ab"
        and keeping "ab" => ("aabb", "ab")
```

### Solution
Anagrams form an [equivalence class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_class) within words,
therefore we may choose an arbitrary arrangement of a given word's characters when comparing as anagrams.
For simplicity we take the sorted characters of a word as the representative of the class.

The task's recipe consists in replacing two or more consecutive words in the same anagram class by the last word of this group.

However, as we just want to count the remaining words, it is irrelevant which anagram from a class we keep and which we drop.

After canonicalizing every word by sorting its characters,
the list can be partitioned into groups of equal consecutive words.
The number of groups gives the requested result.

Though [`PDL`](https://metacpan.org/pod/PDL) is not really made for string processing,
solving this task using
[`PDL::Char`](https://metacpan.org/pod/PDL::Char) is quite easy.
[`qsort`](https://metacpan.org/pod/PDL::Ufunc#qsort) will sort the characters in each word and [`enumvecg`](https://metacpan.org/pod/PDL::Primitive#enumvecg) enumerates the groups of subsequent equal vectors.
(Here a vector is a `PDL::Char` word.)
There are one more groups than the highest index returned from `enumvecg`.

As a bonus we compare anagrams case-insensitive.

```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use PDL;
use PDL::Char;

sub count_anagrams {
    1 + PDL::Char->new(map fc, @_)->qsort->enumvecg->at(-1);
}
```
