Task 1: Broken Keyboard
</h2>
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

You are given a string containing English letters only and also you are given broken keys.

Write a script to return the total words in the given sentence can be typed completely.

### Example 1
```
Input: $str = 'Hello World', @keys = ('d')
Output: 1

With broken key 'd', we can only type the word 'Hello'.
```
### Example 2
```
Input: $str = 'apple banana cherry', @keys = ('a', 'e')
Output: 0
```
### Example 3
```
Input: $str = 'Coding is fun', @keys = ()
Output: 3

No keys broken.
```
### Example 4
```
Input: $str = 'The Weekly Challenge', @keys = ('a','b')
Output: 2
```
### Example 5
```
Input: $str = 'Perl and Python', @keys = ('p')
Output: 1
```

### Solution
Though this task is a duplicate of
[task 1 from week 275]({{site.base_url}}{% post_url 2024-06-28-ch-275 %}#task-1),
it turns out that my former solution does not comply to this week's examples.
Specifically, my old solution cannot handle the case of no broken keys.

So here is a slightly modified version.
```perl
use strict;
use warnings;

sub broken_keys {
    my $typeable = qr{^[^\s@{+shift}]+$}ixx;

    grep /$typeable/, split /\s+/, shift;
}
```

<h2 id="task-2">
Task 2: Reverse Prefix
</h2>
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

---
You are given a string, `$str` and a character in the given string, `$char`.

Write a script to reverse the prefix upto the first occurrence of the given `$char` in the given string `$str` and return the new string.

### Example 1
```
Input: $str = "programming", $char = "g"
Output: "gorpramming"

Reverse of prefix "prog" is "gorp".
```
### Example 2
```
Input: $str = "hello", $char = "h"
Output: "hello"
```
### Example 3
```
Input: $str = "abcdefghij", $char = "h"
Output: "hgfedcbaij"
```
### Example 4
```
Input: $str = "reverse", $char = "s"
Output: "srevere"
```
### Example 5
```
Input: $str = "perl", $char = "r"
Output: "repl"
```
---
### Solution
Search for `$char` within `$str` and reverse the found prefix.
`$chr` is not limited to a single character.
```perl
use strict;
use warnings;

sub reverse_prefix ($chr, $str) {
    $str =~ s/.*?$chr/reverse $&/er;
}

```
