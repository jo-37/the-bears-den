Task 1: Zero Friend
</h2>
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

---
You are given a list of numbers.

Find the number that is closest to zero and return its distance to zero.


### Example 1
```
Input: @nums = (4, 2, -1, 3, -2)
Output: 1

Values closest to 0: -1 and 2 (distance = 1 and 2)
```
### Example 2
```
Input: @nums = (-5, 5, -3, 3, -1, 1)
Output: 1

Values closest to 0: -1 and 1 (distance = 1)
```
### Example 3
```
Input: @ums = (7, -3, 0, 2, -8)
Output: 0

Values closest to 0: 0 (distance = 0)
Exact zero wins regardless of other close values.
```
### Example 4
```
Input: @nums = (-2, -5, -1, -8)
Output: 1

Values closest to 0: -1 and -2 (distance = 1 and 2)
```
### Example 5
```
Input: @nums = (-2, 2, -4, 4, -1, 1)
Output: 1

Values closest to 0: -1 and 1 (distance = 1)
```

### Solution
We just need to find the element having the smallest absolute value.
```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use List::Util 'min';

sub zero_friend {
    min map abs, @_;
}
```

<h2 id="task-2">
Task 2: Champion Team
</h2>
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

---
You have $$n$$ teams in a tournament. A matrix grid tells you which team is stronger between any two teams:

```
If grid[i][j] == 1, then team i is stronger than team j
If grid[i][j] == 0, then team j is stronger than team i
```

Find the champion team - the one with most wins, or if there is no single such team, the strongest of the teams with most wins. (You may assume that there is a definite answer.)

### Example 1
```
Input: @grid = (
                 [0, 1, 1],
                 [0, 0, 1],
                 [0, 0, 0],
               )
Output: Team 0

[0, 1, 1] => Team 0 beats Team 1 and Team 2
[0, 0, 1] => Team 1 beats Team 2
[0, 0, 0] => Team 2 loses to all
```
### Example 2
```
Input: @grid = (
                 [0, 1, 0, 0],
                 [0, 0, 0, 0],
                 [1, 1, 0, 0],
                 [1, 1, 1, 0],
               )
Output: Team 3

[0, 1, 0, 0] => Team 0 beats only Team 1
[0, 0, 0, 0] => Team 1 loses to all
[1, 1, 0, 0] => Team 2 beats Team 0 and Team 1
[1, 1, 1, 0] => Team 3 beats everyone
```
### Example 3
```
Input: @grid = (
                 [0, 1, 0, 1],
                 [0, 0, 1, 1],
                 [1, 0, 0, 0],
                 [0, 0, 1, 0],
               )
Output: Team 0

[0, 1, 0, 1] => Team 0 beats teams 1 and 3
[0, 0, 1, 1] => Team 1 beats teams 2 and 3
[1, 0, 0, 0] => Team 2 beats team 0
[0, 0, 1, 0] => Team 3 beats team 2

Of the teams with 2 wins, Team 0 beats team 1.
```
### Example 4
```
Input: @grid = (
                 [0, 1, 1],
                 [0, 0, 0],
                 [0, 1, 0],
               )
Output: Team 0

[0, 1, 1] => Team 0 beats Team 1 and Team 2
[0, 0, 0] => Team 1 loses to Team 2
[0, 1, 0] => Team 2 beats Team 1 but loses to Team 0
```
### Example 5
```
Input: @grid = (
                 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                 [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
                 [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                 [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
               )
Output: Team 2

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] => Team 0 loses to all
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0] => Team 1 beats only Team 0
[1, 1, 0, 1, 1] => Team 2 beats everyone except self
[1, 1, 0, 0, 0] => Team 3 loses to Team 2
[1, 1, 0, 1, 0] => Team 4 loses to Team 2
```

### Solution
Sorting the teams according to their wins and direct competitions.

We shall interpret a `0` as `-1` as the comparison result for direct competitions.
A team compared to itself would give a result of `0`, but we won't ever compare teams to themselves and can safely ignore the values in the matrix' diagonal.

The last team in the sorted list is the champion.
```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use List::Util 'sum';

sub champion_team {
    my @wins = map {sum @$_} @_;
    (sort {$wins[$a] <=> $wins[$b] || 2 * $_[$a][$b] - 1} 0 .. $#_)[-1];
}
```
