Task 1: Middle Index
</h2>
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

You are given an array of integers, `@ints`.

Write a script to find the leftmost middle index (MI) i.e. the smallest amongst all the possible ones.

> A middle index is an index where ints[0] + ints[1] + … + ints[MI-1] == ints[MI+1] + ints[MI+2] + … + ints[ints.length-1].

```
If MI == 0, the left side sum is considered to be 0. Similarly,
if MI == ints.length - 1, the right side sum is considered to be 0.
```
Return the leftmost MI that satisfies the condition, or -1 if there is no such index.

### Example 1
```
Input: @ints = (2, 3, -1, 8, 4)
Output: 3

The sum of the numbers before index 3 is: 2 + 3 + -1 = 4
The sum of the numbers after index 3 is: 4 = 4
```
### Example 2
```
Input: @ints = (1, -1, 4)
Output: 2

The sum of the numbers before index 2 is: 1 + -1 = 0
The sum of the numbers after index 2 is: 0
```
### Example 3
```
Input: @ints = (2, 5)
Output: -1

There is no valid MI.
```

### Solution
In the equation
```
ints[0] + ints[1] + … + ints[MI-1] ==
ints[MI+1] + ints[MI+2] + … + ints[ints.length-1]
```
we may add `ints[MI]` to both sides, i.e. we consider the middle index's value as contained in both parts.
This leads to a simplification, as we no longer need to handle `MI == 0` and `MI == ints.length - 1` specially because there are no empty parts any longer.

Using [`PDL`](https://metacpan.org/pod/PDL) we can calculate the forward and reverse [cumulative sums](https://metacpan.org/pod/PDL::Ufunc#cumusumover) over the integers and find the first index were both are equal.
```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use PDL;
use PDL::NiceSlice;

sub middle_index {
    my $i = long @_;
    my $mi = which $i->cumusumover == $i(-1:0)->cumusumover->(-1:0);

    $mi->isempty ? -1 : $mi((0));
}
```
