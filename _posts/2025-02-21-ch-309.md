<h2 id="task-1">
Task 1: Min Gap
</h2>
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

---
You are given an array of integers, `@ints`, increasing order.

Write a script to return the element before which you find the smallest gap.

### Example 1
```
Input: @ints = (2, 8, 10, 11, 15)
Output: 11

 8 - 2  => 6
10 - 8  => 2
11 - 10 => 1
15 - 11 => 4

11 is where we found the min gap.
```
### Example 2
```
Input: @ints = (1, 5, 6, 7, 14)
Output: 6

 5 - 1 => 4
 6 - 5 => 1
 7 - 6 => 1
14 - 7 => 7

6 and 7 where we found the min gap, so we pick the first instance.
```
### Example 3
```
Input: @ints = (8, 20, 25, 28)
Output: 28

 8 - 20 => 14
25 - 20 => 5
28 - 25 => 3

28 is where we found the min gap.
```

### Solution
We take the differences between all pairs of consecutive numbers, find the index of the (first) minimum  and pick the integer from the next index.
```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use PDL;
use PDL::NiceSlice;

sub min_gap {
    my $ints = long \@_;
    $ints(($ints(1:-1) - $ints(0:-2))->minimum_ind + 1;-);
}
```

<h2 id="task-2">
Task 2: Min Diff
</h2>
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

---
You are given an array of integers, `@ints`.

Write a script to find the minimum difference between any two elements.

### Example 1
```
Input: @ints = (1, 5, 8, 9)
Output: 1

1, 5 => 5 - 1 => 4
1, 8 => 8 - 1 => 7
1, 9 => 9 - 1 => 8
5, 8 => 8 - 5 => 3
5, 9 => 9 - 5 => 4
8, 9 => 9 - 8 => 1
```
### Example 2
```
Input: @ints = (9, 4, 1, 7)
Output: 2

9, 4 => 9 - 4 => 5
9, 1 => 9 - 1 => 8
9, 7 => 9 - 7 => 2
4, 1 => 4 - 1 => 3
4, 7 => 7 - 4 => 3
1, 7 => 7 - 1 => 6
```

### Solution
We calculate the difference between all number pairs as a matrix, set the matrix' upper right triangle to `BAD` and find the minimum over the absolute values from the remaining elements.
Actually it would be sufficient to set the matrix' diagonal to `BAD` such that an element is never paired with itself.
```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use PDL;
use PDL::NiceSlice;

sub min_diff {
    my $ints = long \@_;
    my $diff = $ints - $ints(*1);
    $diff += zeroes($diff)->setvaltobad(0)->tricpy;

    $diff->abs->min;
}
```

This approach with a complexity of $$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$$ is inefficient.
Other solutions to this task operate on consecutive elements of the sorted list with a complexity of only $$\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$$.
