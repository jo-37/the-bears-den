# Ranked Echelons

## Task 1:
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

---
You are given a array of integers, @ints.

Write a script to find out how many integers are smaller than current i.e. foreach `ints[i]`, count `ints[j] < ints[i]` where `i != j`.

### Example 1
```
Input: @ints = (5, 2, 1, 6)
Output: (2, 1, 0, 3)

For $ints[0] = 5, there are two integers (2,1) smaller than 5.
For $ints[1] = 2, there is one integer (1) smaller than 2.
For $ints[2] = 1, there is none integer smaller than 1.
For $ints[3] = 6, there are three integers (5,2,1) smaller than 6.
```
### Example 2
```
Input: @ints = (1, 2, 0, 3)
Output: (1, 2, 0, 3)
```
### Example 3
```
Input: @ints = (0, 1)
Output: (0, 1)
```
### Example 4
```
Input: @ints = (9, 4, 9, 2)
Output: (2, 1, 2, 0)
```

### Solution

This task is the same as [task 1 in challenge 244](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-244/#TASK1).
Looking for a different approach.

At first let's assume the list elements were unique.


Considering [example 2](#example-2).
We start with an index sort on the list.
```
L: [1, 2, 0, 3] => IS: [2, 0, 1, 3]
```
We may read this as: The element `L[IS[i]]` is the `i`-th element in the sorted list and thus there are `i` elements smaller than `L[IS[i]]`.
Pairing the elements in `IS` with their index yields:
```
[
    [2, 0],
    [0, 1],
    [1, 2],
    [3, 3]
]
```
Sorting by the first column reveals the requested result in the second  column:
```
[
    [0, 1],
    [1, 2],
    [2, 0],
    [3, 3]
]
```
Obviously this fails, when the elements are not unique, as equal values have different positions in the sorted list.
This may be compensated by a "local enumeration", where equal values in a sorted list are assigned a sequence number.
`PDL` has a function `enumvec` that performs just this task.

So with `PDL` we may write this as:
```perl
use PDL;
use PDL::NiceSlice;

sub stc {
    my $l = long @_;
    my $si = $l->qsorti;
    cat($si, sequence($l) - $l->($si)->dummy(0)->enumvec)
        ->xchg(0,1)->qsortvec->((1));
}
```

Given a matrix `M`, check whether the matrix is in reduced row echelon form.

A matrix must have the following properties to be in reduced row echelon form:

1. If a row does not consist entirely of zeros, then the first
   nonzero number in the row is a 1. We call this the leading 1.
2. If there are any rows that consist entirely of zeros, then
   they are grouped together at the bottom of the matrix.
3. In any two successive rows that do not consist entirely of zeros,
   the leading 1 in the lower row occurs farther to the right than
   the leading 1 in the higher row.
4. Each column that contains a leading 1 has zeros everywhere else
   in that column.

For example:

```
[
   [1,0,0,1],
   [0,1,0,2],
   [0,0,1,3]
]
```
The above matrix is in reduced row echelon form since the first nonzero number in each row is a 1, leading 1s in each successive row are farther to the right, and above and below each leading 1 there are only zeros.

For more information check out this [wikipedia}(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_echelon_form) article.

### Example 1
```
    Input: $M = [
                  [1, 1, 0],
                  [0, 1, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0]
                ]
    Output: 0
```
### Example 2
```
    Input: $M = [
                  [0, 1,-2, 0, 1],
                  [0, 0, 0, 1, 3],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
                ]
    Output: 1
```
### Example 3
```
    Input: $M = [
                  [1, 0, 0, 4],
                  [0, 1, 0, 7],
                  [0, 0, 1,-1]
                ]
    Output: 1
```
### Example 4
```
    Input: $M = [
                  [0, 1,-2, 0, 1],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 1, 3],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
                ]
    Output: 0
```
### Example 5
```
    Input: $M = [
                  [0, 1, 0],
                  [1, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0]
                ]
    Output: 0
```
### Example 6
```
    Input: $M = [
                  [4, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 1, 0, 7],
                  [0, 0, 1,-1]
                ]
    Output: 0
```

### Solution

There are some tests to be performed on the given matrix.

 - find all ones in the matrix and get their indices
 - limit the index list to those elements that represent the first `1` in a row.
 - check that the columns from the "first ones" are strictly ascending
 - check that are no nonzero elements before and above each of the "first ones" `1`s
 - identify all zero rows
 - check that the last row having a leading `1` comes before the first zero row
 - check that the number of rows with a leading `1` plus the number of zero rows matches the total number of rows
 - if all these checks have succeeded, the matrix is in reduced echelon form.

As Perl/PDL code:
```perl
use PDL;
use PDL::NiceSlice;

sub is_reduced_echelon {
    my $m = pdl @_;

    my $allones = whichND($m == 1);
    my $firstidx = which($allones->(1)->enumvec == 0);
    my $firstones = $allones->dice('X', $firstidx);
    return unless $firstones->dim(1) < 2 ||
        all $firstones((0),0:-2) < $firstones((0),1:-1);
    for my $firstone ($firstones->dog) {
        my ($col, $row) = $firstone->list;
        return unless 1 == sum $m->dice('X', $row)->(0:$col) != 0;
        return unless 1 == sum $m->dice($col, 'X')->(,0:$row) != 0;
    }
    my $zeros = which $m->orover == 0;
    return unless !$firstones->ngood || !$zeros->ngood ||
        $firstones->((1))->max < $zeros->min;

    return unless $zeros->dim(0) + $firstidx->dim(0) == $m->dim(1);

    1;
}
```
