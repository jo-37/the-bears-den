# Positive, Negative or Divisible?
## Task 1: Max Positive Negative
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

---
You are given an array of integers, `@ints`.

Write a script to return the maximum number of either positive or negative integers in the given array.

### Example 1
```
Input: @ints = (-3, 1, 2, -1, 3, -2, 4)
Output: 4

Count of positive integers: 4
Count of negative integers: 3
Maximum of count of positive and negative integers: 4
```
### Example 2
```
Input: @ints = (-1, -2, -3, 1)
Output: 3

Count of positive integers: 1
Count of negative integers: 3
Maximum of count of positive and negative integers: 3
```
### Example 3
```
Input: @ints = (1,2)
Output: 2

Count of positive integers: 2
Count of negative integers: 0
Maximum of count of positive and negative integers: 2
```
---
### Solution
The values returned from the numeric equality operator `<=>` may be used as an array index to count positive and negative values.
The maximum over the first and the last count is the requested count.
```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use List::Util qw(max reduce);

sub mpn {
	max +(reduce {$a->[1 + ($b <=> 0)]++; $a} [0,0,0], @_)->@[0,2];
}
```

## Task 2: Count Equal Divisible
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

---
You are given an array of integers, `@ints` and an integer `$k`.

Write a script to return the number of pairs (i, j) where

```
a) 0 <= i < j < size of @ints
b) ints[i] == ints[j]
c) i x j is divisible by k
```
### Example 1
```
Input: @ints = (3,1,2,2,2,1,3) and $k = 2
Output: 4

(0, 6) => ints[0] == ints[6] and 0 x 6 is divisible by 2
(2, 3) => ints[2] == ints[3] and 2 x 3 is divisible by 2
(2, 4) => ints[2] == ints[4] and 2 x 4 is divisible by 2
(3, 4) => ints[3] == ints[4] and 3 x 4 is divisible by 2
```
### Example 2
```
Input: @ints = (1,2,3) and $k = 1
Output: 0
```
---
### Solution
The task can be translated to PDL almost literally:

- check the index order
- compare the indexed values
- check the remainder of the index product and `$k`.
- count the elements satisfying the above criteria.

```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use PDL;

sub ced {
    my $k = shift;
	my $l = long @_;
    my $s1 = sequence($l);
    my $s2 = $s1->dummy(0);

    which((($s2 > $s1) & $l->dummy(0) == $l) & ! ($s2 * $s1 % $k))->nelem;
}
```
