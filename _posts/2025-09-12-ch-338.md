Task 1: Highest Row
</h2>
**Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar**

---

You are given a `m x n` matrix.

Write a script to find the highest row sum in the given matrix.

### Example 1
```
Input: @matrix = ([4,  4, 4, 4],
                  [10, 0, 0, 0],
                  [2,  2, 2, 9])
Output: 16

Row 1: 4  + 4 + 4 + 4 => 16
Row 2: 10 + 0 + 0 + 0 => 10
Row 3: 2  + 2 + 2 + 9 => 15
```
### Example 2
```
Input: @matrix = ([1, 5],
                  [7, 3],
                  [3, 5])
Output: 10
```
### Example 3
```
Input: @matrix = ([1, 2, 3],
                  [3, 2, 1])
Output: 6
```
### Example 4
```
Input: @matrix = ([2, 8, 7],
                  [7, 1, 3],
                  [1, 9, 5])
Output: 17
```
### Example 5
```
Input: @matrix = ([10, 20,  30],
                  [5,  5,   5],
                  [0,  100, 0],
                  [25, 25,  25])
Output: 100
```

### Solution
The task can be translated literally to `PDL`:
```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use PDL;

sub highest_row {
    max sumover pdl @_;
}
```

### Solution
#### Procedure
A pair `(x, y)` that provides the maximum distance `|x - y|` must be in the form `x - y`, where `x` is the maximum over one array and `y` is the minimum over the other.
Taking this fact into account, each array can be reduced to its minimum and maximum values.

Find the first and second lowest and highest elements from the minimum and maximum of the arrays.
Let these be $$l_1, l_2, h_1 \text{ and } h_2$$.
From these four values there are three pairs that are candidates for the maximum distance:
$$h_1 - l_1$$, $$h_1 - l_2$$ and $$h_2 - l_1$$, where a pair is valid only if the values stem from different arrays.
As $$l_1$$ and $$l_2$$ as well as $$h_1$$ and $$h_2$$ cannot stem from the same array, there is always at least one valid pair.

Select the largest valid distance as the result.

In the above consideration the number of given arrays is not limited to two, so this approach can be used unmodified on any number of at least two arrays.

With $$n$$ as the array size and $$k$$ as the number of arrays, the approach has a complexity of 
$$\mathcal{O}(n k)$$, which could be considered as optimal.

#### Implementation details
- As the arrays may be of different size, some fiddling is required to represent these in a 2-d ndarray.
Set `undefval` to `BAD` and enable `BAD` values for the ndarray.

- The position of the minimum in a list can be found as the position of the maximum with changed signs.

- The difference of two numbers can be calculated as a vector product:
$$ y - x = (x, y) \cdot (-1, 1)$$
The difference of all pairs within an n-dimensional structure can be calculated in a single operation with this approach.

#### Example
Consider [example 1](#example-1-1) with an additional (irrelevant) array `(6, 5)` for easier distinction of dimensions.

Create a "change sign" constant vector, a "candidate selector" constant matrix and the input matrix:
```
pdl> do_print 1
1
pdl> $diff = long -1, 1
[-1 1]

pdl> $sel = indx [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]

[
 [0 1 0]
 [0 0 1]
]

pdl> $PDL::undefval = badvalue long
-2147483648

pdl> $m = long [4, 5, 7], [6, 5], [9, 1, 3, 4]

[
 [          4           5           7 -2147483648]
 [          6           5 -2147483648 -2147483648]
 [          9           1           3           4]
]

pdl> $m->badflag(1)
1
pdl> $m

[
 [  4   5   7 BAD]
 [  6   5 BAD BAD]
 [  9   1   3   4]
]
```
Create a matrix holding the minimum and maximum of each array:
```
pdl> $mm = cat +($m->minmaximum)[0, 1]

[
 [4 5 1]
 [7 6 9]
]
```
Find the indices of the first and second minimum (with changed signs) and maximum :
```
pdl> $mm2 = maximum_n_ind $mm * $diff(*1), 2

[
 [2 0]
 [2 0]
]
```
Combine indices with their corresponding values:
```
pdl> $stack = $mm2->cat($mm->index1d($mm2))

[
 [
  [2 0]
  [2 0]
 ]
 [
  [1 4]
  [9 7]
 ]
]
```
Select candidate pairs:
```
pdl> $pairs = $stack->index1d($sel)

[
 [
  [2 0 2]
  [2 2 0]
 ]
 [
  [1 4 1]
  [9 9 7]
 ]
]
```
Calculate the differences of all pairs:
```
pdl> $cand = $pairs->xchg(0, 1)->inner($diff)

[
 [ 0  2 -2]
 [ 8  5  6]
]
```
Select the maximum value-difference corresponding to a non-zero index-difference.
```
pdl> $cand(,1)->where($cand(,0))->max
6
```

#### Implementation
```perl
use strict;
use warnings;
use PDL;
use PDL::NiceSlice;

sub max_distance {
    state $diff = long -1, 1;
    state $sel = indx [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1];
    $PDL::undefval = badvalue long;
    (my $m = long @_)->badflag(1);
    my $mm = cat +($m->minmaximum)[0, 1];
    my $mm2 = maximum_n_ind $mm * $diff(*1), 2;
    my $cand = $mm2->cat($mm->index1d($mm2))
        ->index1d($sel)->xchg(0, 1)->inner($diff);

    $cand(,1)->where($cand(,0))->max;
}
