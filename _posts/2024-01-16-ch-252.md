# Special Zeroes

## Task 1: Special Numbers
**Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar**

---
You are given an array of integers, `@ints`.

Write a script to find the sum of the squares of all special elements of the given array.

An element `$int[i]` of `@ints` is called special if `i` divides `n`, i.e. `n % i == 0`.
Where `n` is the length of the given array. Also the array is 1-indexed for the task.

### Example 1
```
Input: @ints = (1, 2, 3, 4)
Output: 21

There are exactly 3 special elements in the given array:
$ints[1] since 1 divides 4,
$ints[2] since 2 divides 4, and
$ints[4] since 4 divides 4.

Hence, the sum of the squares of all special elements of given array:
1 * 1 + 2 * 2 + 4 * 4 = 21.
```
### Example 2
```
Input: @ints = (2, 7, 1, 19, 18, 3)
Output: 63

There are exactly 4 special elements in the given array:
$ints[1] since 1 divides 6,
$ints[2] since 2 divides 6,
$ints[3] since 3 divides 6, and
$ints[6] since 6 divides 6.

Hence, the sum of the squares of all special elements of given array:
2 * 2 + 7 * 7 + 1 * 1 + 3 * 3 = 63
```

### Solution
We need to sum over the squared values of all elements having an 1-based index that divides the size of `@ints`.
There is [divisors](https://metacpan.org/pod/Math::Prime::Util#divisors) in [Math::Prime::Util](https://metacpan.org/pod/Math::Prime::Util) that provides all divisors of a given number and there is [PDL](https://metacpan.org/pod/PDL) that can pick [slices](https://metacpan.org/pod/PDL::NiceSlice#Argument-formats) off, calculate the element-wise [power](https://metacpan.org/pod/PDL::Math#pow) of and the [sum](https://metacpan.org/pod/PDL::Ufunc#sum) over an ndarray.

Putting these together in a single statement:
```
use PDL;
use PDL::NiceSlice;
use Math::Prime::Util 'divisors';

sub snss {
	sum pdl(@_)->(indx(divisors @_) - 1) ** 2
}
```

## Task 2: Unique Sum Zero
**Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar**

---
You are given an integer, `$n`.

Write a script to find an array containing `$n` unique integers such that they add up to zero.

### Example 1
```
Input: $n = 5
Output: (-7, -1, 1, 3, 4)

Two other possible solutions could be as below:
(-5, -1, 1, 2, 3) and (-3, -1, 2, -2, 4).
```
### Example 2
```
Input: $n = 3
Output: (-1, 0, 1)
Example 3
Input: $n = 1
Output: (0)
```
---
### Solution
There are trivial solutions for even and odd values of `$n`:

 * pairs of positive and negative integers with the same absolute value are distinct and sum to zero 
 * adding a zero to such a list keeps the sum at zero, but provides an odd number of elements

This results in:
```
use experimental 'signatures';

sub uniq_sum_zero ($n) {
    (-$n / 2 .. -1, (0) x ($n % 2), 1 .. $n / 2);
}
```
